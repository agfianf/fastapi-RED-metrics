## ‚ö° How to Run

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `make up`
5. Access the FastAPI application at [API Documentation http://localhost:18123/docs](http://localhost:18123/docs)
6. Access Prometheus at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
7. Access Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:9090) 
    - Login (default credentials: admin/admin)
    - Go to Dashboard , select `FastAPP RED Metrics Dashboard`

## How Run the Simulation

- Run `make simulate`

## ü§î What are RED Metrics?

RED metrics are a set of metrics that provide a high-level overview of your service's performance:

- **Rate**: The number of requests per second.
- **Errors**: The number of failed requests per second.
- **Duration**: The amount of time each request takes.

### Benefits of RED Metrics

1. **Simplicity**: RED metrics provide a clear and concise view of your service's health.
2. **Universal applicability**: These metrics are relevant to almost any service or microservice.
3. **Quick problem detection**: Anomalies in any of these metrics can quickly point to issues in your service.
4. **Performance insights**: They help in understanding the service's performance characteristics over time.
5. **Capacity planning**: Rate metrics can be used to plan for scaling and capacity needs.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- `fastapi-app/`: Contains the FastAPI application code.
- `monitoring/`: Contains configuration files for Prometheus and Grafana.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and runs the multi-container Docker application.


## üìà Monitoring

- Use Prometheus to scrape and store the metrics.
- Use Grafana to visualize the metrics with the provided dashboard template.

Enjoy monitoring your FastAPI application with RED metrics!
